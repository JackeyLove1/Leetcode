// Explanation: The output below was generated on a single-core machine. When
// thread1 starts, it enters the loop for the first time and calls increment()
// followed by get(). However, before it can print the returned value to
// std::cout, the scheduler puts thread1 to sleep and wakes up thread2, which
// obviously has time enough to run all three loop iterations at once. Back to
// thread1, still in the first loop iteration, it finally prints its local copy
// of the counter's value, which is 1, to std::cout and then runs the remaining
// two loop iterations. On a multi-core machine, none of the threads is put to
// sleep and the output is more likely to be in ascending order.
